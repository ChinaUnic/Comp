					<h1 class="doov">ABOUT</h1>
					<p><a class="roob" href="go1.html">Robb</a> is a main character from my old visual novel project "HIGH SCHOOL" (i'm not very creative with names). </p>
					<p>He is very bright but does not get along very well with other people because of his arrogance.</p>
					<h1 class="doov">HISTORY</h1>
					<p><a class="roob" href="go1.html">Robb</a> comes from an average family unlike the other students in FAEH HIGH. He has a twin brother named Rob and they were inseparable since birth. Because of their names being almost identical(they're identical twins too), people just read his name with prolonged B's (Like Robbbbbbb-). In his grade school days, he never did have any friends and he only had his brother with him. Everything changed in High School. There, he met the main protagonist which I didn't name yet. Their personalities clash but in the end, they became good friends.</p>
					<p>(Yes, since this is an OTOME game, he is a dateable character. *wink wink*)</p>
