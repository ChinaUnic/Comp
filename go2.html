				<h1>GAMEPLAY</h1>
				<p>It's a visual novel. In other words, an interactive story where every choice matters. You get to meet many different characters in FAEH HIGH and you'll have many different choices depending on which path you're taking.</p>
				<p>It takes a while to make a game like this, especially if you don't have a script like me. Anyway, the game focuses on the young student "Nick" (depending on what you name him but I name him Nick) and his daily life in FAEH HIGH. FAEH HIGH was a school for everyone. In there, nobody cares whether you're rich or poor, tall or short, the only thing that matters is how you do in school. Since this visual novel project was made in 2018, I don't even think I'll be able to finish it in a year. It's fine though. I only made this game so I can do something while I'm waiting for Fire Emblem: Three Houses to come out.</p>
				<h1>PROGRESS</h1>
				<p>I haven't made good progress with this game because we're making another visual novel project and school is killing me. Right now, you can't actually get the game anywhere because it's private in the meantime. I've only done like, only fifteen pages in 6 months. Actually, fifteen pages is a lot but of course, it's not enough. The approximate time for me to finish the game would be about 50 years or so. I'm not really good at making stories and I'm only doing this project on my own. It's really hard being the artist/scriptwriter/music director/voice actor/editor at the same time.</p>
				<p>A few chapters have been made already so it's kinda playable now. (FOUR CHAPTERS.). While I was making the visual novel, I was like "No, I don't think I want to do this anymore." so I stopped for a while but after a week, I went to do it again.</p>
				<h1>EXTRA</h1>
				<p>I don't think I'll get a good grade for writing nonsense XD. I just want to make my website simple and clean, you know? (Kingdom Hearts reference). I should write something to promote my website, so here it is:</p>
				<p>Nick was a good student not just in academics, but in activities and sports too. She(yes a girl) just graduated from middle school and is now going to choose a high school. Unfortunately for her, she cannot go to big schools in the city because she doesn't have enough money. Surprisingly, there was a big school in her hometown that offered her a scholarship. It was FAEH HIGH. Once school has once begun, she toured the school, mesmerized by the view. Everything was perfect. While going through the hallways, she saw a group of delinquents. "Oh no", she thought to herself.</p>
